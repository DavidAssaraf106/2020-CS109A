1. PROBLEM OVERVIEW
--------------------------------
Well-defined questions:

1. Are there certain attributes of bourbons that are predictive of good (i.e., highly rated by customers) bourbons?
	1a. Find hidden gems (i.e., should be good but current reviews are absent or unsupportive of such)
	1b. Find over-hyped whiskeys (i.e., the reviews seem high but the attributes aren't indicative)
	1c. Are there significant results if we target experts' ratings instead of average customer ratings?

2. Are there certain attributes of bourbons that are predictive of expensive bourbons?
	2a. Find under-priced whiskeys
	2b. Find over-priced whiskeys

3. Which bourbons are more similar to each other?
	3a. Which attributes are important for determining similarness? (e.g., does price play a role?)


--------------------------------
2. OBTAINING DATA
--------------------------------
distiller.com has a lot of data and pertinent flavor profiles

1. How much data? 2,139 on the site
2. Can i get it? 2,205 (because iPad user-agent)


--------------------------------
3. DATA SANITY CHECK / CLEANING
--------------------------------

*** QUESTION: how do i calculate the collinearity (VIF) b/w different features?

- filter by those reviewed by an expert: 710
- further filter by those that are bourbons: 586
- how many distinct flavor summaries? 71, but about 20 capture most of them
- how many rare ones? 119 of 586

- how many distinct expert reviewers? 31, but about 15 capture most of them
- what's the summary statistics? .describe() we see that:
- most flavors have a max of 100 but tart and peaty only have a max of 75 and 40, respectively.
- prices are perfectly distributed
- # ratings seem heavily skewed, whereby a few have TONS of reviews

How many unique 'experts' (i.e., authors) are there?
	- 31, but about 15 capture most of them

Any missing values?
	- Customer Rating missing for "Tacoma New West Bourbon" (removed it)
	- Age missing for 379 whiskeys (out of 585), meaning we have 206 (left them all in, cleaned them up)

What are the 'Badge' values (I saw 'rare' while crawling).
	- How many are rare? 119
	- Does it make sense to have that many rare ones? Yes, seems reasonable, as only a few are super common in real life, and there's a long tail of one-off state-local ones.
	- changed 'Badge' column to 'Rare' with TRUE or FALSE values

Fixed data types:
	- 'ABV %' should be a float64;
	- 'Expert score' an int32
	- 'Age' should be a float64


--------------------------------
4. EDA
--------------------------------

Any outliers? look at:
	- smoky (beyond 30)
	- peaty (beyond 0)
	- spicy (less than 40)
	- herbal (beyond 40)
	- oily (beyond 45)
	- full-bodied (less than or equal to 20)
	- briny (beyond 10)
	- salty (10 and beyond)
	- tart (beyond 50)
	- fruity (80 and beyond)
	- what's the oldest?
	- most popular? (most # of reviews)
	- highest/lowest rated (by customers)
	- highest/lowest rated (by experts)
	- most/least expensive
	- distribution of locations: some distilleries make many different bourbons, but then it falls off, and each distillery may make just a few different versions.

What's the distribution of all flavor values? (to ensure they are meaningful)
	- make a histogram for each of the 14 flavors

How does popularity correlate with customer's ratings.
How does popularity correlate with experts' scores.
How does popularity correlate with price.
How does price correlate with experts' scores
	- make a scatter matrix of all.

Do the correlations that exist make sense?
	- Yes

Are there any correlations that we expected to see but didn't observe?
	- No
